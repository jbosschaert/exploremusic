                <h2>What's the Story With This Strange (But Wonderful) Website?</h2>
                <p>Music is extremely important to me. Without it I would live a different
                life, be very bored, and probably wouldn't be sane anymore! I hope that through
                this website I can share some of my favourite music. I warn you in advance, my
                music taste can sometimes be called, strange scary, or just be accused of being noise.
                I love strange and wonderful music, and I hope you will see the epicness of it.</p>
                <p>I originally created this website as a bit of an experiment, a challenge, to see
                if I could build an entire website from scratch, and how much I could learn. However,
                I now continue with this site, updating it frequently, something I had not planned in 
                the beginning.</p>
                <p>P.S there is also a page dedicated to <a href='Unicorns.html'>UNICORNS</a>, check it out. . . </p>
